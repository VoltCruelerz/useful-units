# Useful Units

## Changes

- **Javelis**
    - **Cluster Munitions**: 30% splash damage out to 1000 units
- **Harcka**
    - Something tanky...
        - gap closer
        - draw aggro? (sounds very Advent-y)
        - self-repair? (would cause them to work as marauders, which is Vasari-y)
        - burst?
            - nah, wouldn't make them more important to kill, just more useful to have
        - armor pen?
            - Kol gauss turret mod?
        - **on-hit slow vs frigates**
