## Changes

- **Javelis**
    - **Cluster Munitions**: after research, applies 20% splash damage out to 1000 units
- **Harcka**
    - **Ionized Ammunition**: on-hit, a gun (Harcka's have 5, remember), applies a stacking (up to 20) 1.5% slow for 5 seconds.
- **Marza**
    - **Heavy Missile**: range += 2000, damage += 48 (to counteract mitigation), firing arc += 35
    - **Precision Targeting**: radius: 1200 => 1200/1400/1600/1800, damage 10/20/30/40% => 20/35/50/65%
